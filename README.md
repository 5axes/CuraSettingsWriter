# Html Cura Settings
Cura Plugin for Exporting Settings to an HTML file.

Initial Source from Johnny Matthews :  [github.com/johnnygizmo/CuraSettingsWriter](https://github.com/johnnygizmo/CuraSettingsWriter)

It creates an extra menu option under File -> "Save Project..." that allows you to save all of the settings to an HTML file for review/sharing.
